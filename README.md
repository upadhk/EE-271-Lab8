# EE-271-Lab8

Task - Design and create a game of mastermind with the following guidelines:

       1. The computer must randomly generate a 4 digit code in base 4 ie. only the numbers 0 - 3 are allowed
       2. Using the switches as inputs create a system that shows you how many numbers are correct in value AND position,
          how many numbers are only correct in value but incorrect in position and how many guesses it takes for the user
          to guess.
       3. KEY3 is used as a submit button to submit the guess which then prompts the game to compare it to the original code
       4. To add some pizzaz, I created a hard mode that limits the number of guesses to 10 before a "YOU LOSE" message is displayed
          This mode can be enabled by pressed KEY2 and the easy mode can be reinstated by pressing KEY1
